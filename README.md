# Welcome to the codeacademy repo! 

## Intro
This repository is a curated collection of code challenges, mini-projects, and code examples from my learning journey on Codecademy's Backend Engineering Career Path. As I progress through the course, I aim to use this space as a personal code vault to store and showcase my practical coding endeavors. Whether it's tackling algorithmic challenges, building exciting mini-projects, or experimenting with new coding techniques, this repository will serve as a testament to my growth as a backend engineer. Feel free to explore the code and solutions, and I hope you find them both insightful and inspiring. Happy coding!
